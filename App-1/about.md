Oligomerization in Fluorescent Proteins (FP) hinders the usage as a marker 
for protein tagging. The problems include but not limited to abnormal localization,
interfering with signaling cascades and disturing the normal function of tagged proteins.
Predicting the oligomeric States of Fourescent protein may help live biomedical imaginngs 
and fasten the efforts in creating monomeric FP. Thus, the webserver is dedicated to predict
the oligomeric states of FP using only sequence informations to determine whether uploaded
sequences are Oligomeric or Monomeric FP.
